    "1. Collecting geographical coordinates is not difficult but after googling for more than 2 days, it was not available on open source data websites such as Wikipedia, India gov website, census report websites etc. So, I decided to use Google maps API to fetch latitude and longitude but google API has limited number of calls that I could make with my free account. So, it would take around 15 - 20 days to fetch location of all the neighborhoods in Bangalore.\n",

    "Initially I scrapped list of neighbors’ using beautifulSoup4 from [wikipedia] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_neighbourhoods_in_Bangalore). The table headings becoming the boroughs and data becoming the neighborhoods. Bangalore has 8 boroughs and 64 neighborhoods. So i manually googled each neighborhood to find its corresponding latitude and longitude. After doing so, I produced the following data frame.  \n",
